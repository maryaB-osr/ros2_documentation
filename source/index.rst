The Robot Operating System (ROS) is a set of software libraries and tools for building robot applications.
From drivers to state-of-the-art algorithms, and with powerful developer tools, ROS has what you need for your next robotics project.
And it's all open source.

Since ROS was started in 2007, a lot has changed in the robotics and ROS community.
The goal of the ROS 2 project is to adapt to these changes, leveraging what is great about ROS 1 and improving what isnâ€™t.

Here you will find the official documentation on **ROS 2**, the newest version of ROS.

If you're looking for documentation on ROS 1 (i.e., ROS as it has existed for several years, and what you might be using right now),
check the `ROS wiki <https://wiki.ros.org>`__.

Where to start
--------------

Newcomers and experienced ROS users should consult this overview of our user-centric content to find what they're looking for.

* :ref:`Installation <InstallationGuide>` pages will help you setup ROS 2 for the first time.
  You can choose your platform as well as the installation type and distribution that suits your needs.

* :ref:`Tutorials <Tutorials>` walk you through learning ROS 2,
  whether you're learning from scratch or looking for guidance on achieving more specific goals.

* :ref:`Concepts <ConceptsHome>` are high-level explanations and background information on core ROS 2 concepts,
  which should provide some context for topics covered in the tutorials.

* :ref:`Troubleshooting <Troubleshooting>` guides cover some specific common cases where issues can arise.

* :ref:`Contributing <Contributing>` is what makes ROS 2 great!
  We have guides on best practices and methodology for contributing new ROS 2 content as well as migrating existing content from ROS 1 to ROS 2.

* :ref:`Getting help <Help>` is always encouraged.
  Here you'll find several ways to get answers to your questions or start a discussion.

Learn more
^^^^^^^^^^

There are plenty of resources available online to learn more about ROS 2.
Here's a few to start with:

* `design.ros2.org <https://design.ros2.org>`__ contains various articles on the design decisions behind ROS 2, like:
   * `Why ROS 2? <https://design.ros2.org/articles/why_ros2.html>`__
