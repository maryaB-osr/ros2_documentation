This page describes planned work for ROS 2.
The set of planned features and development efforts should provide insight into the overall direction of ROS 2.
If you would like to see other features on the roadmap, please get in touch with us at info@openrobotics.org.

Galactic Roadmap
----------------

Galactic Geochelone is the ROS 2 release expected in May 2021.
See :ref:`release <galactic-release>` for a detailed timeline.

The items in the roadmap below are the major features being worked on by the ROS 2 community.
Note that the table is in priority order; the higher in the list they are, the more important they are.
The "Size" is an estimated size of the task, where S means person-days to complete, M means person-weeks to complete, and L means person-months to complete.

If you are working on a feature for ROS 2 Galactic and would like to have it listed, please open a pull request to `ROS 2 Documentation <https://github.com/ros2/ros2_documentation>`__.
If you'd like to take on one of these tasks, please :ref:`get in touch with us <Help>`.

Quarterly Roadmap
-----------------

**Product Readiness** is the current focus topic for ROS 2.
Over the next two quarters we will concentrate development efforts on topics that make ROS 2 more suitable for use in production scenarios.
This includes improving the out-of-box experience for common use cases, documentation improvements, and addressing disparities between ROS 1 and ROS 2.

## 2020 Q3(Jul - Sep)

* **Transport Documentation and Configurations**: Describe and document the ROS 2 transport system.
  Provide default configurations for common uses cases along with documentation.
  `Tracking ticket <https://github.com/ros2/ros2/issues/1006>`__.

## 2020 Q4(Oct - Dec)

* **Performance Improvements**: Analyze ``rcl*-level`` performance and resource usage.
  Develop a strategy to improve performance and reduce resource usage based on data from the analysis.
  `Tracking ticket <https://github.com/ros2/ros2/issues/1007>`__.

* **Launch**: Address current shortcoming in launch, and improve launch testing.
  `Tracking ticket <https://github.com/ros2/ros2/issues/1008>`__.

* **Documentation Infrastructure**: Develop package-level documentation generation infrastructure, deploy documentation, and consolidate existing documentation.
  `Tracking ticket <https://github.com/ros2/ros2/issues/1009>`__.
